## Hello! I’m Natasha. 
I'm an iOS developer with a Computer Science degree from BINUS University. 

During college, I actively taught others, explored web and mobile development, and participated in hackathons, using each experience as a way to test ideas, learn fast, and improve my craft.

Outside of work, I read widely across disciplines and paint as a creative outlet, both of which help me see problems from new angles. I also write on Medium to reflect on what I learn and share insights with the community.

I’m always open to thoughtful discussions and learning from others. Feel free to reach out!
