## Hello! I’m Natasha. 
I'm an iOS developer with a Computer Science degree from BINUS University. During college, I was actively involved in teaching, web and mobile development, and hackathons. Currently, I'm focused on deepening my technical skills in Swift and algorithmic problem-solving.

Outside of work, I love reading books on a wide range of topics and I enjoy painting as a creative outlet.

I'm always open for discussions, feel free to reach out!
